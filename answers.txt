part1:
1. process_creation.c:
This program uses fork() to create a new process.
If pid == 0 it is the child, if pid > 0 it is the parent.
So the output shows one line from the child and one from the parent, each with its own PID.

2. file1.c + file2.c:
Here the code is split into two files.
file1.c defines hello(), and file2.c calls hello() from main().
When we compile and link them, the linker connects the call in file2.c to the function in file1.c.
This shows how functions in different files can work together.

3. simple_program.c:
This is a small program that just prints one line.
We use it with ldd to see which shared libraries it needs.
The loader later loads these libraries into memory when the program runs.

Part 2: What is the job of the Linker
The linker takes object files from the compiler and joins them into one executable.
It matches function calls and variables across files and can also add libraries the program needs.
In the end we get a single program that the OS can run.

Part 3: What is the job of the Loader
The loader is part of the OS and runs when we start a program.
It loads the executable and the needed shared libraries into memory, sets up things like the stack,
and then jumps to the start of the program so main() can run.
